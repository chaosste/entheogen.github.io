## What it is

EntheoGen Mixed Modality Guide (formerly NTT) is a ceremonial psychedelic interaction guidance app adapted from SeshGuard. Taking a rigorous approach to harm reduction, EntheoGen's data model is mapped specifically to ceremonial substances and medication classes.

Unlike purely generative AI tools, the interaction output here is strictly evidence-grounded and rule-based. It offers explicit confidence ratings and transparent source traceability. If pharmacological evidence is missing, the engine strictly returns `Unknown` rather than generating speculative predictions.
## Why it is different

- ⚙️ **Evidence-Grounded Risk Engine** — deterministic output based on curated pharmacological rules
- 🛡️ **Strict Safety Posture** — missing-data pairs explicitly resolve to `UNK` (Unknown) rather than guessing
- 🔍 **Source Traceability** — readouts expose confidence and evidentiary source metadata
- 💾 **Privacy Focused** — favorites are stored in local browser storage; hosting/CDN logs may still exist
- 🖤 **Minimalist & Accessible** — clean UI with distinguishable risk levels and non-prescriptive language

## Safety Posture & Disclaimer

EntheoGen provides educational harm-reduction guidance only. It is **not** a substitute for professional medical, psychological, or therapeutic advice. If there is no explicit evidence for an interaction combination, EntheoGen classifies it as `Unknown/Insufficient Data`.

In moments of clinical emergency, seek urgent professional medical help.
